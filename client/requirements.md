## Packages
framer-motion | Essential for futuristic, smooth animations and page transitions
clsx | Utility for conditional class names
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging Tailwind classes safely

## Notes
The design relies heavily on a dark, futuristic aesthetic ("DXD4").
API endpoints are proxied to SellAuth via the backend, so we use internal `/api/*` routes.
Images for products might be null, so a sleek placeholder is required.
